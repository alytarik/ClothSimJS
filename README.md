# p5.js Cloth Simulation

This is a cloth simulation project built using p5.js library. The simulation is based on a mass-spring system, where each point in the cloth is represented as a particle with mass, connected to its neighboring particles with springs.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can also modify the simulation parameters in the `index.js` and `cloth.js` file to customize the behavior of the cloth.

## Simulation Parameters

The following parameters can be modified in the `index.js` file:

- `w` and `h`: width and height of canvas.
- `yCount` and `xCount`: the number of rows and columns in the cloth grid.
